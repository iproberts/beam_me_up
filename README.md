# About
`beam_me_up.py` is a simple Python script used to automatically convert a paper written in LaTeX directly to a Beamer slide deck (also in LaTeX). The script searches through raw LaTeX and extracts specific environments (i.e., figures, equations, etc.), placing each on its own slide in the Beamer slide deck.

# Dependencies
